fss (Fast SAT Solver)
=====================
    By Kamil Dudka <xdudka00@stud.fit.vutbr.cz>, 2008

This archive contains source codes of fss (Fast SAT Solver) bundled with source
codes of GAlib (A C++ Library of Genetic Algorithm Components). You can download
up-to-date fss source codes from http://dudka.cz/fss, GAlib sources from
http://lancet.mit.edu/ga

The software for this work used the GAlib genetic algorithm package, written by
Matthew Wall at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


License
-------
fss is covered by GPL v3+ license, see COPYING file for more details. GAlib is
licensed under terms of MIT license, see LICENSE file in the GAlib directory for
more details.


Build
-----
Build system CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) is required for successful build.
Just type 'make' to build GAlib, compile fss and link against GAlib. On
successful build, binaries will be in directory 'build'. For now only GNU/Linux
is supported, but source codes are intended to be portable. For Gentoo Linux an
ebuild is available on project web page http://dudka.cz/fss

Built executables:
./build/fss             fss executable
./build/fss-satgen      random SAT problem generator (see documentation)


Documentation
-------------
Project documentation (in Czech language only) is in 'doc/proj_doc.pdf', full
LaTeX sources are included. You can also generate API documentation (in English
language) using Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). To do so, go to
doc/api directory and run 'make'. Both documentations are available on the
project web page http://dudka.cz/fss
